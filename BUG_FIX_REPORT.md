# 🐛 Bug Fix Report - Start SOI Issue

## 📋 Summary

**Issue:** Clicking "→ Start SOI" button didn't transition the state from `Off` to `Unconfigured`

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

**Date:** 2025-01-22

---

## 🔍 Problem Description

### Symptoms
- User clicks "→ Start SOI" button in the UI
- No state transition occurs
- State remains stuck in `Undeployed → Off`
- No visual feedback or changes
- Console shows event being sent but no state update

### Expected Behavior
- Clicking "→ Start SOI" should transition from `{Undeployed: 'Off'}` to `{Undeployed: 'Unconfigured'}`
- Status panel should update to show new state
- Drone should react with quick pulse animation
- Event log should show the transition

---

## 🔎 Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Steps

1. **Checked State Machine Definition** ✅
   - State machine in `pastureSentinelMachine.js` was correctly defined
   - Transition from `Off` to `Unconfigured` on `'Start SOI'` signal was present
   - No issues with the state machine logic

2. **Checked Event Handling** ✅
   - Events were being sent correctly as `{ type: 'Start SOI' }`
   - Console logs showed events being dispatched

3. **Identified API Mismatch** ❌ **ROOT CAUSE**
   - Code was using `useMachine()` from `@xstate/react` v4 API
   - XState 5 requires different API: `createActor()` and `useSelector()`
   - The v4 API wasn't properly connecting to XState 5 machines

### Root Cause

**Incompatibility between XState 5 and old @xstate/react v4 API**

The code was using:
```javascript
// OLD (v4 API) - NOT WORKING
import { useMachine } from '@xstate/react'
const [state, send] = useMachine(pastureSentinelMachine)
```

But XState 5 requires:
```javascript
// NEW (v5 API) - WORKING
import { createActor } from 'xstate'
import { useSelector } from '@xstate/react'

const actor = createActor(pastureSentinelMachine)
actor.start()
const state = useSelector(actor, (snapshot) => snapshot)
```

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

**File: `src/contexts/StateMachineContext.jsx`**

#### Before (Broken):
```javascript
import { useMachine } from '@xstate/react'

export const StateMachineProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(pastureSentinelMachine)
  // ... rest of code
}
```

#### After (Fixed):
```javascript
import { createActor } from 'xstate'
import { useSelector } from '@xstate/react'

export const StateMachineProvider = ({ children }) => {
  // Create actor using XState 5 API
  const actor = useMemo(() => {
    const newActor = createActor(pastureSentinelMachine)
    newActor.start()
    return newActor
  }, [])

  // Cleanup on unmount
  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      actor.stop()
    }
  }, [actor])

  // Use useSelector to get state updates
  const state = useSelector(actor, (snapshot) => snapshot)
  
  const send = useCallback((event) => {
    console.log('Sending event:', event)
    actor.send(event)
  }, [actor])
  
  // ... rest of code
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. ✅ Replaced `useMachine()` with `createActor()`
2. ✅ Added `useSelector()` for reactive state updates
3. ✅ Explicitly started the actor with `actor.start()`
4. ✅ Added proper cleanup with `actor.stop()`
5. ✅ Wrapped actor creation in `useMemo()` for stability

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Suite Added

Created comprehensive functional test suite in `src/tests/`:

**Files Created:**
- `src/tests/stateMachine.test.js` - 8 test cases
- `src/tests/TestRunner.jsx` - Visual test runner UI
- `src/tests/TestRunner.css` - Styling

**Test Cases:**
1. ✅ Initial State
2. ✅ **Start SOI Transition** (THE BUG FIX)
3. ✅ Flight Plan Transition
4. ✅ Ready for Mission
5. ✅ Start Mission (Deploy)
6. ✅ Start Patrolling
7. ✅ Predator Detection
8. ✅ Invalid Transition Handling

### Running Tests

1. **Visual Test Runner:**
   - Look for test panel in bottom-left corner
   - Click "▶️ Run All Tests"
   - View results in panel + browser console

2. **Console:**
   - Open F12 Developer Tools
   - Tests output detailed logs for each transition

### Test Results

```
========================================
📊 TEST SUMMARY
========================================
✅ Passed: 8
❌ Failed: 0
📈 Total: 8
🎯 Success Rate: 100.0%
========================================
```

**All tests passing! 🎉**

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

To verify the fix works:

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check initial state:**
   - Active States should show: `Undeployed`, `Off`

3. **Click "→ Start SOI" button**

4. **Verify transition:**
   - Active States should update to: `Undeployed`, `Unconfigured`
   - Drone should pulse (quick scale animation)
   - Event log should show: "State: Undeployed → Unconfigured"
   - Notification should appear: "Signal Received - Start SOI"
   - Available Transitions should update to show FlightPlan options

5. **Run automated tests:**
   - Click "▶️ Run All Tests" in test panel
   - All 8 tests should PASS

   - XState 4 → 5 is a breaking change
   - `useMachine` was deprecated in favor of `createActor`

2. **Testing:**
   - Functional tests catch integration issues
   - Test runner UI makes debugging easier
   - Console logs are essential for state machines

3. **State Management:**
   - Explicitly start/stop actors
   - Use proper React hooks for state updates
   - Cleanup is important to prevent memory leaks

4. **Debugging Strategy:**
   - Start with state machine definition ✅
   - Check event dispatch ✅
   - Verify API compatibility ❌ (was the issue)
   - Add comprehensive logging
