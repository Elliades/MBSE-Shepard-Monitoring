# 🎨 UI Redesign Summary

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 📊 Left Panel - Streamlined Information

#### 1. **Mission Objectives** (Kept as-is)
- Shows mission title and description
- Lists mission objectives with progress indicators
- Provides context for the current mission

#### 2. **Active States** (Redesigned Status Panel)
Shows exactly what you requested:

**Current Active States:**
- Main state displayed with badge
- Active substates listed clearly
- Clean, easy-to-read format

**Available Transitions:**
- Shows ONLY transitions available from current state
- Each transition is a clickable button
- Button shows the signal name
- Hover shows: `from state → to state`

#### **Drone Positioning**
- **Before Deployment:** Drone sits ON the base station
  - Position: bottom-left (same as base station)
  - Shows current state underneath
  
- **After Deployment:** Drone moves to field center
  - Smooth transition from base to field
  - Continues mission as normal

#### **Drone State Label**
- Small text underneath drone
- Shows: `MainState → Substate1 → Substate2`
- Example: `Deployed → Patrolling → Sheep Monitoring`
- Dark background with white text
- Always visible, follows drone
- Font size: 0.65rem (small, unobtrusive)

### 📋 Right Panel - Logs (Kept as-is)

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. **Focused State Information**
Before: Mixed system stats, generic buttons
After: Clear active states + only relevant transitions

### 2. **Context-Aware Actions**
Before: All buttons shown, most disabled
After: Only available transitions shown, all clickable

### 3. **Visual Field Context**
Before: Drone appeared out of nowhere
After: Drone starts at base station, deploys naturally

### 4. **Drone State Visibility**
Before: State only in side panel
After: State visible directly on field under drone

### 5. **Cleaner Layout**
Before: 5 panels on left (crowded)
After: 3 focused panels (mission, states, config)
